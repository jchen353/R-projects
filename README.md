model insights

Hi! In this repository, I'm presenting projects that I've completed with R. Models I utilized were among liner regression models, 
linear & quadratic discriminant analysis, K - Nearest Neighbors, lasso models, ridge models,principal component regressions, decision trees
and support vector models.
